// This function should test if the factor is a factor of base.
// Return true if it is a factor or false if it is not.
// About factors
// Factors are numbers you can multiply together to get another number.
// 2 and 3 are factors of 6 because: 2 * 3 = 6
// You can find a factor by dividing numbers. If the remainder is 0 then the number is a factor.
// You can use the mod operator (%) in most languages to check for a remainder
// For example 2 is not a factor of 7 because: 7 % 2 = 1
// Note: base is a non-negative number, factor is a positive number.


function checkForFactor (base, factor) {
    return base % factor === 0
  }
console.log(checkForFactor(121, 11))


//   Very simple, given an integer or a floating-point number, find its opposite.
// Examples:
// 1: -1
// 14: -14
// -34: 34
